1. Motivation: introduce use case (why are we doing this?)
what is 3D printing, why do you need it?
what is lattice structure?

2. How do you design this today? -> CAD and simulations.
why is it so complicated at the moment? (simulation expensive and long) PROBLEM!!

3. This is how we solved it (ML replaces simulations)
on website: input: variables. output: porosity, approximate effective stiffness (ML)
Build database
optimize what the structure should look like.
-> You don't always have to do simulations (easier to use, much faster, still very accurate)
