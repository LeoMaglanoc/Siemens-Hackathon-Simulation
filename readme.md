This repo contains all the code for the Siemens Hackathon Project titled "Smart 3D Printing with Machine Learning". We trained various models to predict the stiffness of a 3D printed design. The Siemens Simulation Software provided the training and test dataset, but the datapoints needed to be converted with a separate script.
